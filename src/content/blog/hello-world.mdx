import LikeButton from '../../components/LikeButton';

Welcome to my tech blog! In this inaugural post, I'll walk you through the **Island Architecture** pattern that makes Astro such a powerful framework for building high-performance websites.

## What is Island Architecture?

Island Architecture is a paradigm where the page is rendered as static HTML, with "islands" of interactivity that can be hydrated independently. Think of it like an ocean of static content with small islands of dynamic, JavaScript-powered components.

```typescript
// A static component renders as pure HTML - zero JS!
import Header from '../components/Header';

// An island with client:visible only loads JS when scrolled into view
<LikeButton client:visible />
```

## Why It Matters

Traditional SPAs ship a massive JavaScript bundle that must be downloaded, parsed, and executed before the user sees anything. With Island Architecture:

1. **Faster Initial Load** - The page is server-rendered HTML
2. **Selective Hydration** - Only interactive components load JavaScript
3. **Progressive Enhancement** - Static content works without JS
4. **Better Core Web Vitals** - Smaller bundles = better LCP & TTI

## Interactive Demo

Here's a live example of an "island" - a React component with `useState` that only hydrates when you scroll to it:

<div className="not-prose my-8 flex items-center justify-center rounded-xl border border-[var(--color-border)] bg-[var(--color-bg-tertiary)] p-8">
  <LikeButton client:visible initialLikes={42} />
</div>

The button above is a **React component** using `client:visible`. It ships zero JavaScript until you scroll it into view. Click it to see the state update!

## Code Example: Creating an Island

Here's how you embed an interactive React component in an Astro page:

```astro
---
// In your .astro file
import LikeButton from '../components/LikeButton';
---

<!-- Static HTML - no JS -->
<article class="prose">
  <h1>My Blog Post</h1>
  <p>This content is pure HTML.</p>
  
  <!-- This is an "island" - it will hydrate with React -->
  <LikeButton client:visible initialLikes={10} />
</article>
```

The `client:visible` directive tells Astro to:
1. Render the component's initial HTML on the server
2. Wait until the element is visible in the viewport
3. Only then load and hydrate the React runtime

## Client Directives

Astro provides several directives for controlling hydration:

| Directive | Behavior |
|-----------|----------|
| `client:load` | Hydrate immediately on page load |
| `client:idle` | Hydrate when the browser is idle |
| `client:visible` | Hydrate when scrolled into view |
| `client:media` | Hydrate when a media query matches |
| `client:only` | Skip SSR, only render on client |

## Conclusion

Island Architecture isn't just a performance optimization—it's a fundamentally better mental model for building websites. Ship less JavaScript, make your users happier, and keep the interactivity where it matters.

If you found this helpful, smash that like button below! (Yes, it's another island 🏝️)

<div className="not-prose mt-8 flex items-center gap-4">
  <LikeButton client:visible />
  <span className="text-[var(--color-text-muted)]">Thanks for reading!</span>
</div>
