Hey everyone — welcome to the first post in this new tutorial series.

Over the next few weeks, I'll be building a full-stack LLM chat platform from scratch, mostly by vibe coding. The goal is to replicate the core experience of modern AI chatbots (think ChatGPT or Gemini), while also adding features like forking conversations, supporting multiple LLM providers, and letting users refine their own system prompts.

This series is primarily about exploring what's possible with today's state-of-the-art models. If you're new to coding (or new to building with AI-assisted workflows), this will be a practical look at how far we can get by combining solid engineering fundamentals with modern tools like **Cursor**.

Crucially, **we are not treating AI as a black box.** The goal here is to accelerate development while ensuring we still understand and intentionally make every architectural choice from the get-go.

## A note on my workflow

I am using AI to assist with the content creation itself. I use tools like **Nano Banana** to generate the hero images, and I use LLMs to help polish my writing structure.

As a developer from Venezuela, English isn't my native language. AI helps me connect my ideas cohesively, but I want to be clear: **the opinions, code decisions, and technical direction are 100% mine.** I review and verify every section to ensure this isn't just "AI-generated junk," but a high-quality resource you can trust.

If this sounds interesting, I'm open to discussion regarding features, architecture suggestions, and implementation tradeoffs. The codebase will be open source on GitHub under the **MIT license**, and contributions are welcome.

I'm aiming to publish one article per week until we ship a complete product. Let's get building.

**Next up:** [Part 2: Tech Stack & Tooling Choices](https://blog.sneyderangulo.com/blog/vibe-coding-full-stack-ai-chatbot-part-2) is now available! We'll dive into selecting the perfect tech stack for our AI chatbot platform, covering the reasoning behind each choice and how they'll work together to create a robust, scalable solution.
